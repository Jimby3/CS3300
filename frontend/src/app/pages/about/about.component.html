    <h2>About TaskTrackr</h2>
    <p>TaskTrackr is a platform created by a group of students at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs to help
      others manage assignments, projects, and deadlines effectively. Whether you're working on projects or tracking
      tasks, our app simplifies the process. TaskTrackr originated as a semester project for CS 3300: Introduction to
      Advanced Software Engineering, taught by Dr. Armin Moin in the Fall of 2024.</p>
